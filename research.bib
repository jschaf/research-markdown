  ABSTRACT =      {An accurate automatic personal identification is critical to
                   wide range of application domains such as access control,
                   electronic commerce, and welfare benefits disbursement.
                   Traditional personal identification methods (e.g., password,
                   PIN) suffer from a number of drawbacks and are unable to
                   satisfy the security requirement of our highly
                   inter-connected information society. Biometrics refers to
                   automatic identification of an individual based on her
                   physiological or behavioral traits. While biometrics is not
                   an identification panacea, it is begining to provide very
                   powerful tools for the problems requiring positive
                   identification. },
